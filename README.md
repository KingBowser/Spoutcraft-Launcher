This is a modified tekkit launcher that supports a sort of "Ignore Incongruous MD5 Sum(s) Feature".
It was made in response to the obscenely odd MD5 mismatches occurring due to what appears to mod repository negligence.

Technic Launcher (based off SpoutCraft Installer)

The goal of this launcher is to provide a one-click method to switch modpacks and versions in as simple a manner as possible for the end user!
